"""Drive a running example through its hero turns in a headless browser and save screenshots.

Requires the vertical's API and app to be running (scripts/run_demo.py) and Playwright with
Chromium (``pip install playwright && playwright install chromium``):

    python scripts/screenshot_tour.py --vertical travel [--base-url URL] [--out DIR]
    python scripts/screenshot_tour.py --vertical travel --merchant

A storefront tour captures the home, a mid-stream frame, each turn, the vertical's second view
(orders, trips, account, tickets), the shopper's sheet, and the activity panel twice (memory
marked, then the last reply's steps). A portal tour captures the views, the opening turns, the
applied state after approving the staged change, the turns that follow the approval, and the
same two activity-panel frames. Output goes to /tmp/acme-<vertical>-tour or
/tmp/acme-<vertical>-merchant-tour.
