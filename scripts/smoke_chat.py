"""A scripted live conversation against one vertical example API, in-process or against a
running server, asserting that each turn calls the expected tools and emits the expected
events. Merchant arcs also assert the approval gate: a chat approval applies nothing, the
arc then approves through the portal endpoint, and any later turns run against the applied
state. A vertical may add deterministic checks that run after its conversation
(``POST_CHECKS``).
