# commerce-agents

For agents working in this repo, commerce-builder plugin users included. The public
reference for commerce agents on Claude: a shopping agent and a merchant agent on three
paths each, five vertical examples, and a Claude Code plugin.

## Layout

- `commerce-common/commerce_common/`: what both roles share; its `__init__` lists the modules.
  `foundry_openai` is the odd one out: a platform adapter, not a mechanism, filling the
  `client=` seam for a Foundry tenant with no Anthropic deployment (needs `azure-identity`);
  it sends on Foundry's `responses` surface by default because a reasoning model refuses
  function tools on `chat/completions`.
- `shopping-agent/core/shopping_agent/`: types, `StorefrontBackend`, config, prompt, `tools/`, gates, enrichment, executor.
- `merchant-agent/core/merchant_agent/`: the merchant equivalents, plus `changes.py` and `analysis.py`.
- `*/skills/`: five flows per role, one `SKILL.md` each.
- `*/runtime-messages-api/`: `ShoppingAgent`, `MerchantAgent`, the merchant analysis delegate.
- `*/runtime-agent-sdk/`: each agent as `ClaudeAgentOptions`, with a console.
- `*/managed-agents/`: the manifest directory (with the derived `system.md`) and the role's MCP server.
- `examples/demo_common/` and `examples/web-shared/`: what the verticals' APIs and web apps share; `examples/` is the npm workspace.
  A deployment's two additions live here too, both inert until their variables are set:
  the HTTP Basic gate in `host.py` and `web-shared/gateway.ts`, and that gateway's
  same-origin API proxy, which is how a browser reaches a gated API it cannot send
  credentials to.
- `examples/<vertical>/`: `api/`, `data/`, `storefront-web/`, `merchant-web/`; ports 8000-8004, 3000-3004, 3100-3104.
- `plugins/commerce-builder/`: six skills, four commands; `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` points at it.
- `docs/`: `safety.md`, `backends.md`, `deployment.md`. `scripts/`: install, demo, smoke, screenshots, check, deploy, verify.
- `tests/`: the suites that span packages (both roles on all three paths); each package keeps its own `tests/`.

`requirements.txt` installs the seven packages and their pinned dependencies (`requirements-dev.txt`
adds pytest and ruff); `scripts/install.sh` runs it.

## Design rules

- One model owns the conversation; a rule goes in a tool description, the prompt, or a skill by how often it applies.
- The static prompt and `tools[]` are the same bytes on every turn; per-request data goes in the fenced block after the breakpoint.
- UI is presentation tool calls, validated and filled in on the server, streamed as `ui` events.
- Third-party content is fenced data; writes are provenance-gated and capped in code; `checkout` charges nothing; merchant writes apply only through host approval.
- Core is domain-neutral; a vertical adds UI through `PresentationExtension` and keeps the rest to itself.
- Each mechanism is defined once, in `commerce_common` or a role core, and shared by all three paths.

## Fictional and original

No real company, brand, product, or person appears: the companies are ACME and its lines,
and Heartland Agronomy Supply and its lines in `examples/agronomy/`; every brand, prompt,
schema, and figure is invented here. The agronomy example additionally invents every crop,
pest, label rate, and restriction it shows, and none of it is agronomic advice. Two
exceptions: deployment and integration targets (the README's "MCP connectors" section;
platform and SDK names in `docs/deployment.md`, the README's deploying section, and the
platform tests), and CC0 category photos listed in the `IMAGE-CREDITS.md` beside them. When
in doubt, redesign rather than rename.

## Conventions

- Python 3.11+, `ruff` (root `ruff.toml`), `pytest` (root `pytest.ini`), type hints, `pydantic` schemas; web apps are Next.js and TypeScript.
- Skill descriptions name the request class, without sample utterances; tool descriptions say when the tool applies; examples stay schematic.
- A change to prompt text, a tool description, a skill, or a fence notice re-derives `system.md`; `scripts/check.py` compares them.
- Prose: plain declarative sentences; one term per thing; each fact once, naming its module; each role in its own terms; a README says what a thing is, how to run it, and where its interfaces are; no history, dates, or process narrative; cut before restyling.
- A new module updates this file and its README.

## Verify

```bash
ruff check . && ruff format --check . && pytest && python scripts/check.py
python scripts/verify_all.py          # adds deploy dry runs and web builds
```
